# Circle Geometry

This Java project provides an utility to compute geometry for circles. Currently, the following feature is supported:

- `isCenterInsideTargetCircle` determines if the center of one circle lies within the area of another circle.

## Future ideas

Future updates may include additional functionalities such as:

- Calculating the intersection area between two circles.
- Determining if two circles overlap.
- Finding the tangent lines from a point outside the circle.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lawlight33/llw33-circle-geometry.git
cd circle-geometry-checker
javac -d bin Main.java
java -cp bin Main
```
